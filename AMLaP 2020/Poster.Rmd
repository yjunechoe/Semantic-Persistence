# Misinterpretations of <br> Garden-Path Sentences

Previous research on **post-repair representations** of **garden-path sentences** has found that readers arrive at misinterpretations despite evidence of reanalysis [1].

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-size:30pt"><u>As Harry chewed the brown and juicy steak fell to the floor.</u></span>

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align='center', fig.height=3, echo = FALSE}
grid.raster(readPNG("tree.png"))
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Q: <span style="font-size:30pt">Did Harry chew the steak? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (**Yes**/No) </span>
  
At the same time, comprehenders are accurate when asked about material _outside_ the region of ambiguity.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Q: <span style="font-size:30pt">Did the steak fall to the floor? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (**Yes**/No) </span>

Suggests that comprehenders are not failing to make _any_ sense out of these sentences entirely - misinterpretations seem to be patterened and systematic.

# The Locus of Misinterpretations

Some proposed explanations:

 1. **_The initial semantic commitments_** made in the garden path can persist in working memory without undergoing necessary revisions [2].

 2. **_The incorrect local structure_** can linger in the syntactic representation blended/copied alongside the correct structure, licensing the misinterpretation [3].

 3. **_Surface-level heuristics_** can be adopted as a compensatory "good enough" strategy when syntactic reanalysis becomes too costly [4].

More recent studies find evidence that the parser actually always succeeds in recovering the globally correct structure in reanalysis [5][6] - likely that the misinterpreation stems from the **persistence of the initial misanalysis in memory** as opposed to failures related to the syntactic structure-building process
<br>

# Research Question

<p style="font-size:46pt;font-family:Arial">**Is the likelihood of misinterpretation affected by the _depth of semantic processing_ in the initial misparse?**</p>

In an **auditory comprehension experiment**, we draw on _two known effects of pitch accent on semantic processing_:

1. In American English, a high-rising pitch accent is often associated with semantic focus, and facilitates encoding and retrieval of referent [7].

2. This interpretation of focus is sensitive to the **position of the accented word** in the prosodic phrase [8].

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _Ex._: Anna dressed the BABY.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - _Anna dressed the BABY._ $\quad$ (default accent)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - _Anna dressed the [$_N$ BABY]$_{F}$._ $\quad$ (contrastive focus)

In garden-path sentences, this accent-to-focus relationship can facilitate an **asymmetrical interpretation of focus** over the region of ambiguity between alternative parses:

<div class="sentence">

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>While Anna **DRESSED** the baby stopped crying.</u>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - _While Anna DRESSED, the baby ..._
<br>
$\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad$(default accent, early closure)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - _While Anna [$_V$ DRESSED]$_{F}$ the baby, ..._
<br>
$\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad$(contrastive accent, late closure)

</div>

But no such asymmetry when the subject is accented:

<div class="sentence">

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>While **ANNA** dressed the baby stopped crying.</u>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - _While [$_{NP}$ ANNA]$_{F}$ dressed, the baby ..._
<br>
$\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad$(contrastive accent, early closure)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - _While [$_{NP}$ ANNA]$_{F}$ dressed the baby, ..._
<br>
$\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad$(contrastive accent, late closure)

</div>

We predict **lower accuracy** on comprehension questions in the **verb-accent condition**, where the intitial misanalysis in the late-closure parse is _enriched_ with focus-semantic meaning that later _requires revision_.

<div class="sentence">

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q: Was the baby dressed? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Yes/No)

</div>

# Materials

Twenty-four garden-path sentences were recorded in subject/verb-accent conditions and **resynthesized** to make prosodic phrase boundary cues uninformative (to induce the garden-path effect):

1. A trained male speaker produced the early- and late-closure variants of each sentence: _While Anna dressed the baby ($\emptyset$/he) slept_.

```{r, out.width='70%', fig.align='center', fig.height=3, include = FALSE}
include_graphics("raw_duration.png")
```

2. The durations of pre-boundary candidates (1<sup>st</sup> verb, 2<sup>nd</sup> noun) were resynthesized to the average of the two variants, with early-closure recordings as the source.

```{r, out.width='90%', fig.align='center', fig.height=3, include = FALSE}
include_graphics("resynth_duration.png")
```

3. Disambiguating region was spliced from the subject-accent recordings into the verb-accent recordings and the f0 contour was interpolated across the clause boundary and flattened over the main clause.

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align='center', out.height="20%", fig.show="hold", echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("merged.png")
```

<div style="line-height: 10pt"><br></div>
```{r echo=FALSE,out.width='100%', fig.align='center', fig.height=3, warning=FALSE}
library(gt)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
resynth_table <- readRDS("resynth_table.rds")
resynth_table %>% 
  tab_header(title = md("**Resynthesized Measures**"),
             subtitle = NULL) %>% 
  tab_options(table.width = "90%",
              table.font.size = "65%") %>% 
  cols_align('center')
```

```{r, out.width='70%', fig.align='center', fig.height=3, include = FALSE}
include_graphics("resynth_pitch.png")
```

<div style="line-height: 15pt"><br></div>

<div style="columns:2">

4. Sentences were **normed** for _transitivity bias_ (of the adjunct verb) and _semantic fit_ (of the 2nd NP as the embedded object) to control for local coherence effects.

# Discussion

<div style="line-height:28pt">

Evidence for **semantic nature** of the persistence effect:

<div style="line-height:44pt">

1. **Longer response times in the critical trials** compared to unambiguous fillers indicate that listeners were garden-pathed in both conditions as intended.

2. **Negative effect of (verb) pitch accent on accuracy** suggests that the processing of focus semantic meaning in the garden path increased the persistence of the erroneous interpretation.

3. **No response time differences between conditions** suggests that (focus) semantic processing is not necessarily tied to syntactic structure-building.

4. This effect of pitch accenting on semantic persistence is significant **after controlling for local coherence effects** (transitivity bias and semantic fit).

</div>

Additional implications:

<div style="line-height:44pt">

- <u>Prosody in psycholinguistics</u>: "semantic processing" as discussed in prosody and sentence processing research may be more closely linked than previously thought.

- <u>Parallel vs. Serial</u>: transitivity as a non-significant predictor of accuracy might point to an _incremental semantic processor_ acting independently in reanalysis.
